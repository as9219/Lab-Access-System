This project showcases the CRUD Operations and a GUI Interface using <code>PyQt5</code> in Python. The database used for this project was <code>firebase</code>. The GUI was made using a module PyQt5.

To compile this program, you will need to have Python installed and have a suitable IDE, like Visual Studio Code.<br><br>
- Download the latest version of <b>Python </b><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>
- Make sure to add Python to <code>'PATH'</code> when installing<br>

<br>Next, clone this repository using the following git command: <br>
  <code>git clone https://github.com/as9219/SUNLAB-Card-Access.git</code>

After cloning this repository, you will need to install <code>firebase-admin</code> and <code>PyQt5</code>. You can skip these steps if you already have these modules installed. Open the terminal in your IDE and type in the following commands:
